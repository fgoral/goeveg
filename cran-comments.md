## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added \value to all .Rd files
* Updated references in documentations with DOI links

Issues leading earlier removal from CRAN were fixed by removal of the concerned function from package

## Test environments
* local windows install, R 4.0.5
* win-builder (devel and release)
* ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS (on travis-ci), R 4.0.2

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 notes
